= Rails Templates

NOTE: this is unfinished. Not all options are thoroughly tested.

== INFO

So far, I'm still working on the "base" template, which contains:

* jquery (not the gem, just jquery)
* lesscss and more
* will_paginate
* cucumber
* shoulda
* factory_girl
* mocha

and will ask you if you want:

* your option of reset.css, sens.css, or 960gs (for less, with 12, 16, or 24 grid base options)
* a form builder (formtastic)
* paperclip
* sprockets and sprockets-rails (my version of sprockets-rails http://github.com/amiel/sprockets-rails)
* hoptoad_notifier
* authlogic and authlogic_generator
* spreadhead

== TO INSTALL

Add this function, courtesy of Ryan Bates, to your bash profile.

	function cmapp {
		appname=$1
		shift
		rails $appname -m http://github.com/amiel/rails-templates/raw/master/carnes_media.rb $@
	}

== USAGE

TODO: explain these things
* title
* body_class
* js_var
* more...



== TODO
* instructions at end of template
* other handy jquery plugins (Boxy? )
* write more info on features in this doc

* more for heroku
* heroku capistrano tasks and asset packing for deploy (http://casperfabricius.com/site/2009/09/20/manage-and-rollback-heroku-deployments-capistrano-style/)
** concept is in Capfile and compiled_assets.rake, need to cleanup, etc
